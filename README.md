**NASA PHOTO APP**

**Description**

This app has been developed with the purpose of retrieving Nasa mission data for reading and references.
The design pattern used on the app is MVVM – model view viewmodel – and written in Swift 4.2. 
The app does not use any 3rd party libraries.
The calling of the details pane can further be optimized to free memory by passing values into the user interface elements instead of saving them in variables.

**Installation**

To run this app, you will require XCode. Download the project files and open the Nasa.xcodeproj

**Usage**

The app simply downloads data from a NASA API and displays missions. When a user taps on a mission, they are directed to a details pane where they are provided with more information regarding the mission.
